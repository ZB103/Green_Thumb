Project Green Thumb
The Fabulous Trio




Description: 
Project Green Thumb is designed to use a moisture sensor and read the amount of moisture the soil in a plant has. Once the moisture level in the soil drops too low, an audio file will be played telling the user that the plant needs to be watered. The user will be able to see a graph of each reading and the time through a GUI. This GUI also contains a chart of all readings, a watering schedule, and settings the user can change for more customization.
